this project's aim is a voxel game engine like the way minecraft works

This is all done in C without the use of high-level libraries.
This means that almost all of the work is mine with the exceptions of calls to operating system functions.
Currently this application is mostly designed with Directx and windows in mind, however I may consider other platforms in the future.
